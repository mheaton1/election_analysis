## Election-Audit Summary 
###### This script can be used for any election. For example the script can be used to in a country wide presidental election. This would allow us to be able to analyze how each state votes. It can also be used to see how different voting turn outs are per state. Of course a state like california would have a more significant turn out than a state like New Jersey so we would have to break it down per  capita. We could mostly like run a code to divide the turn out of Californias voters to match New Jersey turn outs per capita.
